# light-sample-project
Vehicles service, backend.

This is the sample of my own project, that was a fast developed project (about 7-10 days with all html code and css)
and the main feature of this project is an ideal architecture 
(FrontEnd (Bootstrap 3x) <--> Angular-JS <--> Web Api 2.2 <--> Service Layer (Buisness Logic) <-->
Data Objects Layer (Entity FrameWork 6x) <--> DataBase (MS SQL Server)).
You can look at this example for the best understanding of how I work.
